# Graphene-Django demo

### Objective:

To create a Django application using graphene-django, connected with MySQL database. The application will act as a scheduling system that allows the authenticated users to create reservable appointment slots that others can view and book.

### Entities:

- User

- Slot

- Appointment



### Workflow:

- Users can create a schedule of available dates and times and select their desired meeting intervals : (15 min / 30 min / 45 min) 

- Users can performe CRUD operations ( create / read / update / delete ) on slots

- Non-users can view all available slots for a specific user

- Non-users can reserve a specific time by providing their full name and email for the meeting



### Validations:

- User can not create duplicate slots. This means that two slots with same start time and slot interval can not exist.

- Reserved slots can not be edited.

- Expired slots (start time older than current time) can not be edited.

- User can edit or delete  own slot.

- Non-user canâ€™t reserve a time that has  already been reserved
